## **About the Repository**
<p align = "justify">
Greetings! Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks of the <b>Exercises, Case Studies, and Projects</b> I completed during my 3-month Summer School DS-ML course hosted by the <b>Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (MIT-IDSS)</b> via the GreatLearning Platform. Within this repository, you can find <b>7 Branches</b> (aside from the main) which I have created to segregate the notebooks according to the DSML techniques used:
  
1. **Data Science Foundations** - Statistics and Python Libraries for DSML, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis
2. **Unsupervised Learning** - Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering
3. **Supervised Learning** - LInear/Nonlinear Regression Algorithms and Prediction
4. **Supervised Learning** - Classification Models
5. **Deep Learning** - Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks
6. **Networking and Graphical Analysis** - Network Analysis and Graphical Visualization
7. **Other DSML Applications** - Recommendation Systems and Predictive Analytics

## **Within Each Jupyter Notebook**
<p align = "justify">
In each of the notebooks, you can find the <b>Title</b> of the Project/Case Study, the <b>Context</b> of the work, some <b>descriptions on the Dataset</b> used, and the <b>Objectives</b>. These are then followed by lines of code (with comments) as well as descriptive texts that aims to discuss and guide the readers through the process

## **How to Use**
As mentioned above, the files uploaded are Jupyter notebooks whose codes have already been compiled. Please **DO NOT MAKE ANY FORM OF EDIT** on the files, as they **ARE ONLY FOR VIEWING**

### **Note**
> When navigating through notebooks within the 7 Branches, sometimes the **Error 404: Page not Found** pops out. If this happens, you can go back to the `main` page of the Repository by clicking `Data-Science-Portfolio` <b>near my profile picture</b>. From there, click on the branch of interest and open the notebook you want to view.
