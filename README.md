## **About the Repository**
<p align = "justify">
Greetings! Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks of the <b>Exercises, Case Studies, and Projects</b> I completed during my 3-month Summer School DS-ML course hosted by the <b>Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (MIT-IDSS)</b> via the GreatLearning Platform. Within this repository, you can find <b>7 Branches</b> which I have created to segregate the notebooks according to the DSML techniques used:
  
1. **Data Science Foundations** - Python, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistics
2. **Unsupervised Learning** - Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering
3. **Supervised Learning** - LInear/Nonlinear Regression and Prediction
4. **Supervised Learning** - Classification Models
5. **Deep Learning** - Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks
6. **Networking and Graphical Analysis** - Network Analysis and Graphical Visualization
7. **Other DSML Applications** - Recommendation Systems and Predictive Analytics

## **Within Each Jupyter Notebook**
<p align = "justify">
In each of the notebooks, you can find the title of the Project/Case Study, the Context of the work, some descriptions on the Dataset used, and the Objectives. These are then followed by lines of code (with comments) as well as descriptive texts that aims to discuss and guide the readers through the process

## **How to Use**
As mentioned above, the files uploaded are Jupyter notebooks whose codes have already been compiled. Please **DO NOT MAKE ANY FORM OF EDIT** on the files, as they **ARE ONLY FOR VIEWING**

### **Note**
When navigating through notebooks within the 7 Branches, sometimes the **Error 404: Page not Found** pops out. If this happens, you can go back to the `main` page of the Repository by clicking `Data-Science-Portfolio` near my profile picture. From there, click on the branch and open the notebook you want to view.
